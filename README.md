# MoviePredictionModel
A movie revenue prediction model co-written by ChatGPT with neural networks and UI design.

Project Aspects:
1. dataRetrieval.py: Leverages the TMDB API tool to gather movie budget, runtime, and release month.
2. predictionMode.py: Neural network trained to predict movie revenue based on budget, runtime, and release month. Architecture includes: (3 inputs -> 16 neurons -> 16 neurons -> 1 revenue prediction).
3. revenuePrediction.py: UI interface for interaction with model prediction.

Goals:
Familiarize self with real-world data sets, machine learning techniques, UI design, and AI-assisted coding platforms.
